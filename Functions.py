# Functions
# Pandas provide a large number of predefined functions that can be applied on the data structures seen above. Some of the most used in data analysis are:

s1 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])
s2 = pd.Series([4, 5, 6])
d1 = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
d2 = pd.DataFrame([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])

print(s1)
print(s2)
print(d1)
print(d2)
print('*****')
# Arithmetic operations
